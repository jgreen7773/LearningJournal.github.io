            ls -a
		        LS -a will list all files and folders (including private)
			-a is a FLAG that modifies the command

	        ls -l
		        LS -L will show permissions, dates, and files…etc

	        ls -al
                LS-AL will give permissions levels, AND private files
            ls
                LS stands for list (all public files and folders)
        
            ~
                Back to root directory

            open .
                opens current location of terminal
        
            cd
                changes directory
        
            pwd
                pwd stands for print working directory (“where am I?”)
        
            clear (ctrl+L)
                just moves the typing field to the top (more space to work with)
        
            mkdir (mkdir samplefolder)
                makes a directory (make a new folder)
                    Use LS to check to see the folder you just made
                        Use CD to enter that folder
            touch
                creates a file
                    sample (index.html , or sample.txt)
        
            touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
                creates 3 separate files
        
            mkdir subfolder-1 subfulder-2
                cd subfolder-1
            ls
                type ls to check if anything is inside subfolder-1
        
            cd .. (a space between the dots)
                goes back one folder
            
            pwd
                to see directory
        
            cd sample-folder/subfolder-1
                you can type the full directory
                    you can also get modules to TAB through directories
        
            cd ../..
                will go backwards one more directory

            rm sample.txt
		        RM stands for remove file (not a folder and/or directory)

	        rm -r (stands for recursively)
		        Stand for remove a folder AND everything in it “recursively”

	        rm -rf (stands for recursively with FORCE-stands for fire—don’t use this…)
                removes all files of directory WITH FORCE
                git status

	        git add (file name)
		        ACP - Add, Commit, Push
			        stages a file for commit	
				        DON’T FORGET THIS
	        git add .
		        stages all files (as opposed to one)

	        git commit -m “added a sample text file”
		        -m is a flag for a “message”
	
	        git log
		        shows all the commits (history of changes you’ve made)

	        git push origin (origin means the original url) master
                upload changes onto github
                
	        git push origin (branch name)
                upload changes onto GitHub into a specially designated location
        
	        git init
                allows GitHub to track my file without pulling it from GitHub
                
	        git pull origin master
		        pulls all of the current repository

            <area>One important thing to consider when coding, is how you will keep your data clean.
                What I mean by clean, is readable. Being able to read code requires that you separate the 
                different languages as much, and as cleanly as possible.
                That means keeping HTML code in a .html file, and CSS code in a .css file, and the same for a .js file.
                When creating a website just enhance it little by little, and you should continually go back to view the web-page 
                to see what your code is doing. You can do this easily in the Chrome development tool add-on, and to open the tool 
                just press [Command + Option + i].
                Create a basic javascript file with the following commands:
                    var today = new Date();
                    var hourNow = today.getHours();
                    var greeting;

                    if (hourNow > 18) {
                        greeting = 'Good evening!';}
                    else if (hourNow > 12) {
                        greeting = 'Good afternoon!';}
                    else if (hourNow > 0) {
                        greeting = 'Good morning!';}
                    else {
                        greeting = 'Welcome!';}


                    document.write('[h3]' + greeting + '[/h3]');



                For html code the tags will be encased in [these] brackets so the code doesn't read as real code.
                Create a basic html file with the following commands.
                    [!DOCTYPE html]
                    [html]
                        [head]
                            [title]Constructive &amp; Co.[/title]
                            [link rel="stylesheet" href="css/c01.css" /]
                        [/head]
                        [body]
                            [h1]Constructive &amp; Co.[/h1]
                            [script src="js/add-content.js"][/script]
                            [p]For all orders and inquiries please call 
                                [em]555-3344[/em][/p]
                        [/body]
                    [/html]


                
                
                I learned how to link an .js file to the HTML file like this:
                    [script src="app.js">Java Script Link[/script]

                
                
                I learned next, how to use objects and methods.
                    A method is a command that is run on a property of an object, or the object itself.
                        Writtin like this:

                        document.write('Good afternoon!')
                    There it is, simple as that!
