        <article>I learned how to ignore files through the given command in the terminal</article>
        <article>git rm --cached .DS_Store (to remove said file in current repository)</article>
        <article>This next step is special because it makes a rule to ignore said file</article>
        <article>echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global</article>
        <article>This last step is also special (and needed) because it uses -newly made rule- for ALL FILES</article>
        <article>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global</article>

            Hey, what's up? You want to know how to mess with the terminal and github then huh?
            GitHub is what they term a "DVCS". It means each person in the group that wants to work 
            on code, can simply work together without causing operational friction. People pull files down
            and push them back to the same place without creating "bad-code-hazards" because of the file-save system.
            You can always go back a to a previous version of the files before any mistake becomes a problem.

        PS. I ran into this "DS_Store" file simply because I wanted to add a new file (image) into my page, and practice my HTML
