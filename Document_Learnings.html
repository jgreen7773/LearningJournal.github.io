            Hey, what's up? You want to know how to mess with the terminal and github then huh?
            GitHub is what they term a "DVCS". It means each person in the group that wants to work 
            on code, can simply work together without causing operational friction. People pull files down
            and push them back to the same place without creating "bad-code-hazards" because of the file-save system.
            You can always go back a to a previous version of the files before any mistake becomes a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is my entry for the Lab 04 website.

				Everything in the {} is the declaration  h1, h2, h3 { 		font-family: Arial; 		color: yellow;} 				The PROPERTY goes before the colon :
				The VALUE goes after the colon, ends with semi colon ;  * {} 				Universal selector  		IF TWO SELECTORS ARE IDENTICAL, the latter takes precedence      CSS COLORING: 	3 different ways to enter the code 		p { color : DarkCyan ; } 		p { color : #ee3e80 ; } 		p { color : rgb ( 100, 37, 58 ) ; }
 	Some Properties to experiment with 		{ background-color : rgb ( 0, 0, 0 ) ; opacity : 0.5 ; }	 		{ background-color : hsl ( 0, 0%, 73% ) ; }

		putting a highlighting arrow under a hyperlink (selected)    FLOATS 	Needs to be understood from a CSS 2 perspective AND CSS 3, separately
		Used to wrap text around image 			People don’t use it for this
		Used for images that are vertical to make them horizontal
			Float : left ; 				This will collapse space that is below any area of the float
					20 px margin will not drop the item down at all 					240 px margin will not drop down 					320 px margin will drop because the measure starts 						from the point of the float 						Just don’t worry about that funky float behavior
