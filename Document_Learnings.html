            		Hey, what's up? You want to know how to mess with the terminal and github then huh?
            		GitHub is what they term a "DVCS". It means each person in the group that wants to work 
            		on code, can simply work together without causing operational friction. People pull files down
            		and push them back to the same place without creating "bad-code-hazards" because of the file-save system.
            		You can always go back a to a previous version of the files before any mistake becomes a problem.
        		</p>

					JavaScript and Functions!
				</h3>
				JAVA SCRIPT



<script src=“app.js”>Java Script Reference</script> 		THIS IS PLACED RIGHT ABOVE CLOSING BODY TAG (faster loading) 

WHAT DOES LOGIC AND CONTROL FLOW MEAN?


What is an ARRAY OF INFORMATION? 

1 - Understand programming concepts 2 - understand syntax
3 - understand programming constructs
4 - understand best practices within an open field
 Most widely used, most powerful programming language on the web

Java has a set of rules for formatting, if you don’t follow them, it won’t work.  As a beginner, you want structure. 	Begin by really knowing structure, by exploring the limits

JS6 = ES6 	don’t refer to it as JS6, use ES6 
NAMING VARIABLES or FUNCTIONS is a hard thing in coding JS
 VARIABLES ARE ABOUT RE-USABILITY



A test environment syntax will not work in a browser syntax environment VScode





 SYNTAX SUGAR = shorter syntax commands
  DATA TYPES
	String		TEXT “wrapped in quotes” ‘single or double’ 	Number		40 	variable		A way to save other data types 	conditionals	conditional logic 		if / else 		otherwise 	input 	output
	boolean		True/False
	

  


 Examples:
	var num = 10 	num + num
		>>20 	var first = Brian 	var last = Nations 	first + last 		>>Brian Nations   
When building out apps, go back through ALL the code and write comments for every single thing.
	THIS IS IMPORTANT, AND IT WILL HELP QUITE A WHOLE LOT 		Some dude wrote a giant TUTORIAL of comments for every piece of 			info and rocketed his knowledge in JavaScript






   JS COMMANDS:  console.log(1 + 1);				repl.it    (read; evaluate; print; loop)
	Best tool for debugging code
Var ten = 10
Var chicken = 20
Var first = “James”
Var last = ‘Green’
First + last = James Green first + “ “ + last = James Green
Comment tag for JavaScript is //
	Don’t put a ton of comments, just one for a whole section/function


=== use this			strict command
== not this			loose command
 var name = 'james';

if(name === 'sam') {
  console.log( 'your name is sam' );
} else {
  console.log('your name is james')
}


var result = 'you got it!';

if(10 +10 === 20) {console.log(result);}
else {console.log('incorrect')}














Google Chrome JavaScript writing tool for JS Code on ANY WEB PAGE
	command + option + i

















Grouping and Similarity 	Proximity 	Closure 	Continuance 	White Space 	Color 	Borders






Visual Hierarchy 	Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find 			information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets 		across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for. 		Size 			Larger elements will grab users’ attention first. Headers/Keys 		Color
			Foreground and background color can draw attention to keys.
				Brighter sections draw users’ attention first.
		Style
			An element may have same size/color, use style to stand out.

 To decide what information goes on each page, use CARD SORTING: 	Place each piece of information on a separate piece of paper, then organize 	them into groups

SITE MAP:

	The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. It will show how the pages can be grouped. 
	The primary objective of any visual design is to communicate.
		Use Visual Hierarchy
		Use Similarity Grouping
 Home 	About 		History 		Foundation 		Future Plans
	Articles 		News 		Book Reviews 		Press 		Interviews 	Visit 		Location 		Opening Times
		Tickets 	Shop 		Books 		Gifts 	Contact   BUILDING THE WEBSITE (THINGS TO CONSIDER)  	Who is the site for? 		Just understand who would be interested, and for what reasons 		Study demographics (age, urban/rural living, educated?, family/single? 
	Why people visit your website? 		Key Motivations 		Specific Goals

	Now you know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now 	you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their 	goals quickly and effectively.
		One of the most important things is not having to dive down a rabbit 			hole to find what they need, nobody wants that.
		Having a very aggressive call-to-action is a good way to get 				newcomers (depending on customer demographics/type of sales)

	Goods/Services
		How often do the same people return to purchase?
		How often is your stock updated or your service changed? 			Build a friendly edit (easily edited page)
	
	Information
		What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates?  











DAY 4 READING
				Creatable Things In Java

ACCESSING INFORMATION/CONTENT
	One can access all of the text (content too?) inside of an html document tag  
MODIFY CONTENT 	Can ADD or CREATE a paragraph into the h1 element or modify it.

PROGRAMMING RECIPES or, RULES 	A gallery script can check to see what image a user clicked, and make it big

REACT TO EVENTS 	button pressed, link is clicked on, information added to form, ETA counter






1 === ‘1’		false - integer is not = to string
1 == ‘1’		true - because java thinks you wanted the integer and not string
	Pro developers do not use ==
		Using == will return “close” information to internal search




prompt(what is your fav #)
	10 - java will turn into a string
		parseint(“10”)
			will make => 10
	Java is



SCRIPT:
	Two write a script        						FUNCTIONS console.log()
	log is a function, method, and property on the console object
		. Means objects
				function add()	{
						return 1+1; 						var five = 5;
						var seven = 3;
						var three = 3;
						return five + seven + three; 						}
					After wrapping {} this code, it can be reused by typing:
						add()
			A function “encapsulates” code
				which gives us re-usability
				and modularity

				  				function multiply(Abraham) {
						return a*b; 						}
					After giving a multiply function LETTERS
						multiply(2,4) will name the letters A, and B
			A PARAMETER is a thing inside of my function that receives data
				parameters are placeholders
			Like-wise, the numbers in the multiply() are ARGUMENTS
				arguments are real data

				
				
				prompt(what numbers do you want to multiply? 					input 2, 5
						Label space, with the IF command
							Label comma, with the IFNOT/ELSE command
				alert(your result is “var nam”)  				can use this to GET USERNAME/PASSWORD
					encapsulate with a function 						then rewrite to get username/password 30 times




				function add(a, b, c) { 							console.log(‘sum:’, a + b + c);
				}
					‘sum:’ becomes an ARGUMENT
						A function within a function
							‘sum:’ is a label for console object
								give a label to every console object
					




				function multiply (a, b) { 							return a * b; 							}
					This function has a return
				
				var nameLogger = function(name) { 								console.log(‘your name is ‘ + name); 								}
				function nameLogger(name) { 								console.log(‘your name is’, name);
								}
					These 2 above functions do the exact same 						thing but:
						The latter function is typed/looks cleaner

								13: 13: 49 die sooner? Faith sooner.






	function hideElement(el) { 			var element = document.getElementsByTagName(el) [0];
			element.style.display = ‘none’;
			}
	hide first element (‘p’); 	hide first element (‘div’);


					an ELEMENT is something in CSS
						a paragraph or section or header, etc….			
	
	



	function spin(el) { 			var element = document.getElementById(el); 			element.style.transition = ‘5000ms all’;
			element.style.transform = rotate(1080deg);
			}			

	spin(‘#header-container’)

			to get this to work, attach a transition to the element using:
				element.style { 						}  



	


IF YOU ARE A GOOD DEVELOPER:
	a function should do 1 thing, and 1 thing WELL
		don’t build 1 app as a function, build 50 functions





				something.word.cool.stuff.hi(); 					what does something, word, cool, stuff, hi do?
						look at it from the rear end 							hi is a function of stuff, which is an object of 
							cool, which is an object of word, which is an 							object of something.
								THIS IS MODULAR

Reflection and Discussion
Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.
Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.
Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts
Read
This selected reading is a few very specific pages, with a hands-on exercise in the middle of it. Don’t worry yet about the intro chapter, we’ll read that next time.
* Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Pages 43 - 69.
    * DO ALONG: pages 46 - 49
        * Create a new repo on GitHub for the files you’ll be working with. Clone it locally.
        * Look for the steps to follow, numbered in green circles.
        * Do each step, 1 - 8, on your own computer.
        * Commit the result, and push it to your remote repo.
    * Then complete the readings, and summarize in your learning journal.

ANGULAR TEXT EDIT key
	<ng-app=“my-app”>

DO NOT COPY CODE FROM NOTES or other SOURCES
	the WRONG type of text can enter, utf-8…….or…….UC8….whatever it is. 	




LOOPS-TWO TYPES:
	FOR LOOPS and WHILE LOOPS
		Loop can be defined with the word -iterate- 			EXAMPLE of FOR-LOOPS: -has 3 elements-
				[“apples”, “pears”, “kiwis”] - this is an array
				-apples
				-pears
				-bananas
				-kiwis
					Loop looks for something “found banana”…then finishes


					

for(var I = 0; I < 10; I++) { 		console.log(‘current iteration: ‘, i); 		}
			KEY POINT: <  is  less than so the iteration will only go to 9, not 10


for(var index = 0; index <=; index++) { 		console.log(‘current iteration:’, index);
		}

			KEY POINT: use definitions to replace i…..such as…..products


For (var I = 0; I < 10; I++) { 	if (I <= 5 {
	console.log(‘less than 5:’, I); 	} else {
	break; 	console.log(‘more than 5:’, I); 	}
}



For (var I = 0; I < 10; I++) { 	if (I === 8) { 	break;
	}
}




Var people = [‘Brian’, ‘Jamie’, ‘sally’];

For (var I = 0; I < people.length; I++) {
	console.log(‘name:’, people[I];
	if (people[I] === ‘sally’) {
	console.log(‘you found sally!’); 




	for(var I=0; I=10; I++) { 				console.log(i); 				}


				I=0;     -   index/starting point.   		-starting point
				I=10.    -   # of iterations				-how many times
				I++	    -   incrementer/decrementer	-up or down


	ADD A CONDITION
				.log(i); if(i===5) break;
								break; means kick me out of this loop
									use to find user matching then break


	FILTER BARS (grab all blue t-shirts)
		use FOR loops to create filter search









			EXAMPLE of WHILE-LOOPS:

	while(condition) { 		run my code 		}


	var counter = 0;

	while(counter = 10) {
		console.log(‘my counter:’, counter); 		}
			This counter is ALWAYS equal to ZERO 				It will INFINITE LOOP, and crash computer
					This piece of code changes the game:




	var counter = 0;

		while(counter = 10) {
			counter++;
			console.log(‘my counter:’, counter); 			}
					

while(true) { 	do something 	}










					ARRAYS -a.k.a- Collection of Data (list)

Array of strings:
	[“sam”, “turkey”, “job”] assigned integers [0, 1, 2]

Series of arrays-examples:
	var nums = [10, 20, 50, 100, 1000];

	nums.length			-returns NUMBER of items in array
	nums[0]				-returns first item in array
	nums[0] + nums[2]		-adds two 


	var names = [“Brian”, “sam”, “sally”];
	var upNames = [];

	for (var I = 0; I = names.length; I++) { 		upNames.push(names[I].toUpperCase()); 		}


		upNames = [] is an empty array, it will become an array of data later
	
	
	var mums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	var squared = [];

	for (var I = 0; I = 5; I++) {}
	for (var I = 0; I = nums.length; I++) {}






	var mums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
	var squared = [];

	for (var I = 0; I = nums.length; I++) {
		squared.push(nums[I] * nums[I]);
		}
			Creates an ARRAY of SQUARED NUMBERS


Function squareNums(arr) {
	var squared = []
	for (var I = 0; I = arr.length; I++) {
		squared.push(arr[i] * arr[i]);
	}
	return squared;
}




	var nums = [2, 3, 6, 100, 300, 90, 48, 76];
	squareNums(nums);


	prompt(‘some question’)

				<li>How is information represented using electricity?</li>
					<ol>
						<li>First, electricity was coded as either a "1", or a "0"...depending on it's on-or-off, true-or-false, yes-or-no state.</li>
						<li>Second, a language had to be invented consisting only of "1's", or "0's".</li>
						<li>Last of all, the elements of a circuitboard accept and receive the language in sequences of numbers, kind of like words without letters.</li>
					</ol>
					<ul>
						<li>The on-or-off, yes-or-no, true-or-false, 0-or-1 state represents "1 bit".</li>
						<li>Any number can be represented using only 1's and 0's.</li>
						<li>Text, images, and sound can also be represented using only 1's and 0's.</li>
					</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>How do computers use circuits?</li>
					<ol>
						<li>Different types of circuits have different functions:</li>
					</ol>
					<ul>
						<li>Flipper circuit: changes 0(off) to 1(on) and 1(on) to 0(off), respectively.</li>
						<li>And circuit: will only give you a 1(on) when both incoming signals are 1(on). If one is 0(off) it returns a 0(off).</li>
						<li>Adder circuit: multiple "Adders" are put side by side to do math calculations, because 1 adder circuit can only calculate a maximum of two numbers.</li>
						<li>There are many other types of circuits that are used for various other methods of translation.</li>

			<ol>
				<li>What is code? And how does software control hardware?</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The encompassing answer to this question lies in the 4 step process of computing.</li>
							<ol>
								<li>The computer must have input via input devices such as keyboards, mice, remote controllers, cameras(self obtaining data conversion input--e.g. face recog software).</li>
								<li>Next, the computer receives the input commands through 1's and 0's (binary code) from things like tv remotes, keyboards, etc...and makes a "how-to" request to 'Memory'(storage).</li>
								<li>The request then goes to the CPU to interperet step-by-step "how-to" instructions on how to translate that "code".</li>
								<li>The resulting translation is what we lastly, call output. The "code" has been interpereted into a viable output operation or function.</li>

				<li>An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value, it stores a list of values.</li>
				<li>Creating an Array:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>var colors;</li>
						<li>colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];</li>
						<li>var el = document.getElementById('colors');</li>
						<li>el.textContent = colors[0];</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Creating an Array using an "array constructor":</li>
					<ol>
						<li>var colors = new Array('white', 'black', 'custom');</li>
						<li>var el = document.getElementById('colors');</li>
						<li>el.textContent = colors[0]</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list that starts not with 1, but 0.</li>
				<li>Accessing/Changing Values in an Array:</li>
					<ol>
						<li>// Create the array</li>
						<li>var colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom'];</li>
						<li>// Update the third item in the array</li>
						<li>colors[2] = 'beige';</li>
						<li>// Get the element with an id of colors</li>
						<li>var el = document.getElementById('colors');</li>
						<li>// Replace with third item from the array</li>
						<li>el.textContent = colors[2];</li>
					</ol>

				<li>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world.</li>
				<li>In an object, variables and functions take on new names.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>In an object: variables become known as properties.</li>
						<li>In an object: functions become known as methods.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>This object represents a hotel. It has five properties and one mtehod. The object is in curly braces. It is stored in a variable called hotel.</li>
					<ol><b>These are properties</b>
						<li>var hotel = {</li>
						<li>name: 'Quay',</li>
						<li>rooms: 40,</li>
						<li>booked: 25,</li>
						<li>gym: true,</li>
						<li>roomTypes: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],</li>
					</ol>
					<ol><b>This is the function (method)</b>
						<li>checkAvailability: function() {</li>
						<li>return this.rooms - this.booked;</li>
						<li>}</li>
						<li>};</li>
						<li>The object is then named 'hotel' and can be called like this:</li>
						<li>hotel.checkavailability(parameters go here)</li>
					</ol>
				<li>Be in remembrance of literal notation and dot notation for creating objects</li>
				<li>Updating an object:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>hotel.name = 'Park';</li>
					</ul>
