        <article>I learned how to ignore files through the given command in the terminal</article>
        <article>git rm --cached .DS_Store (to remove said file in current repository)</article>
        <article>This next step is special because it makes a rule to ignore said file</article>
        <article>echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore_global</article>
        <article>This last step is also special (and needed) because it uses -newly made rule- for ALL FILES</article>
        <article>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global</article>

        PS. I ran into this "DS_Store" file simply because I wanted to add a new file (image) into my page, and practice my HTML
