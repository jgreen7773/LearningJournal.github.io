# Code 102: Intro to Software Development    
## What is my story? They want to help me capture it.
### “Learning to Learn” is the first objective

GitHub - application

Complete and Open environment conduct code
 Growth mindset “Principle”

Prepare to fail: it is part of the skill development process

Failing is part of the software development process: they will send your file back broken  
Learn to Learn

“Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.”
Frank Herbert
Author, Dune

Path Learning
Leads you along
Students are consumers of information
Predictable outcomes
Creates dependency
The goal: an exchange of information

Constantly experiment things I don’t know, just soak up information on every turn, every endeavor

Sandbox Learning
Fosters exploration
Students are co-creators of their own learning experience
Wide range of outcomes
Creates autonomy
The goal: learning and discovery

The trust to be able to be autonomous and finish things alone Talk to teacher about the experiences for jobs

Skills for Sandbox Learning
Generating and selecting ideas: what do you want to learn now?
Planning your learning: managing scope, finding resources
Experimentation: keeping track of what you’ve tried, what’s worked, and what hasn’t (maybe just take notes as you work-paper notebooks are GOLD) and take the steps to break the concepts mentally in your head and cement it in your memory
Reflection: pausing every so often to review

The Learning Pit: This is legitimately a real thing in the tech industry

After you think you understand the concepts, they begin to deepen and broaden
	Have fun in the pit of knowing nothing
What is Mindset?
Mindset: self-perception or self-theory that people hold about themselves

Fixed mindset: believing basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. Believing that talent alone creates success—without effort.

		Get rid of the word “talent” and replace it with the word “skilled”
Growth mindset: believing that people’s most basic abilities can be developed

Prepare Your Brain

“A few modern philosophers assert that an individual’s intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity that which cannot be increased. We must protest against this brutal…
When you want to tell yourself…	Remember that…

I’m not good at this.	No one is good at it when just beginning.

I give up. Trying a new strategy will give you a way forward.

This is too hard.	It’s meant to be too hard. We grow by challenging ourselves.

I made a mistake.	That proves you’ve put in effort. What effort is helpful next?

I’ll never be that smart.	Being smart is something you learn. You aren’t done getting smarter.

My classmate can do it, but I can’t	There was a time they couldn’t either. How’d they get to where they are now

It’s not easy, I can’t figure it out, IDK! >>>>….

Others may have a background or stumbled upon a quick way, learn from them…
DO WHAT EVER YOU CAN TO BE HEALTHY

WE ARE MINDFUL BY DESIGN!

Learn how to build a website through GitHub pages ON YOUR OWN
(quick use of resources)
GitHub is a simple resource, (why not use it—unless otherwise prohibited)

What is the vision of the teacher? The vision of others?

Repository: a project (or series of projects)
Where you can take pieces of code and past things on the internet

	A repository is a place to collaborate on code
		An entire ecosystem that revolves around GitHub ecosystem
ADEQUATE SLEEP AND TONS OF EXERCISE FOR THIS JOB

GitHub 	New> Create a repository 	-Name (jgreen.github.io) (data retrieval will try to guess your intentions in making such a specific address or domain name
-Delete a repository is a homework assignment

A repository is similar to a bucket and/or filing folder

Github pages > choose theme
What is markdown?
-informational documentation and format for consistent

GITHUB is a place for constant edit and trial of an app through communal collaboration for continual improvement of an app or piece of code

Consistency is key to providing a base of understanding and layout
How does this work in social relations? Also, business relations? As well as management positions?

		Mongo
		Express
		React
		Node
		Notepad or Notepad++
		vsCode
		
		GitHub’s Atom
		Microsoft’s VS Code, Visual Studio
		(Vim, Emacs, Nano) -these are for professionals-, TextMate
(Not a Prog)	IDE (Interactive Development Environment)

		AWS is an alternative to GitHub (amazon’s tasking)
		
		
	WYSIWYG
		Microsoft Word
		Google Docs
		Apple Pages
		WordPerfect?…etc
“Syntax Highlighting” debugging tool is a great tool

The Terminal (CLI or command line interface)
Find files
Change directories
move and copy files
open files
make new files/folders
All these are the same as “File Explorer” tasks

Text editor programs for SYNTAX have “packages” and they help with integrating the ecosystem of different text editor color-coding and syntax operations

TERMINAL COMMANDS

FLAGS (modifiers of commands)
ls -a
LS -a will list all files and folders (including private)
-a is a FLAG that modifies the command
ls -l
LS -L will show permissions, dates, and files…etc
ls -al
LS-AL will give permissions levels, AND private files

DOTFILES
dot files start with a dot and are considered configuration files (settings)

ls
	LS stands for list (all public files and folders)
open .
	opens current location of terminal
cd                  Cd ~
	changes directory
pwd
	pwd stands for print working directory (“where am I?”)
clear (ctrl+L)
	just moves the typing field to the top (more space to work with)
mkdir (mkdir samplefolder)
	makes a directory (make a new folder)
		Use LS to check to see the folder you just made
			Use CD to enter that folder
touch
	creates a file
		sample (index.html , or sample.txt)
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
	creates 3 separate files
mkdir subfolder-1 subfulder-2
		cd subfolder-1
		ls
			type ls to check if anything is inside subfolder-1
cd .. (a space between the dots)
	goes back one folder
		pwd to see directory
cd sample-folder/subfolder-1
	you can type the full directory
		you can also get modules to TAB through directories
cd ../..
	will go backwards one more directory
cd ../../..
	etc…
WE JUST LEARNED HOW TO CREATE FILES AND FOLDERS without GUI

Continuing on…
rm sample.txt
RM stands for remove file (not a folder and/or directory)
rm -r (stands for recursively)
Stand for remove a folder AND everything in it “recursively”
rm -rf (stands for recursively with FORCE-stands for fire—don’t use this…)
removes all files of directory WITH FORCE
 Tip
touch sample.txt
Next:
Code .

cat readme.txt
	internal contents of any file (not folder)
Here are notes for anybody to use, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to make a Learning Journal Repo using a website scheme like we did with the Growth Mindset homework.










NEWLY ADDED NOTES and UPDATED ENTRY for LAB 03




DAY 2


Git is “The Stupid Content Tracker”
	“DVCS for the masses”
		Distributed Version Control System
			


WHAT IS GIT?
It’s a version control system
It lets multiple developers work on the same code
A history of changes to your files
	1st. Made file
	2nd. Added code
	3rd. Added more code
The ability to view, apply, and remove those changes
	Roll back code for sales in faulty code that goes “live”
Keep all of your project files in one repository
	1 Repository for an app
		Not a lot of repositories for 1 app
			It is simply a place to save my code
It makes collaboration possible!

WITHOUT VERSION CONTROL
	Look familiar?
		term_paper.docx
		term_paper2.docx
		term_paper2_with_footnotes.docx
			New edited files every so often is a messy way to \

WITHOUT DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL
		Person 1
			term_paper 1, term_paper 2, final_paper, final_edit
		Person 2
			term_paper 1, edit_copy, final_edit, final_paper
	COLLABORATION OF GROUP EFFORTS
		Person 1 & 2 combine finals and
			integration_paper 1, 2, and 3, etc



SNAPSHOTS IN TIME
	Commits represent each successive version of a file or files.
	Commits are the Git equivalent of “Save As…”
		Commits are basically a timeline, or history, of what was done 	Each commit (snapshot) has a label that points to it
	HEAD = The label meaning “You Are Here”
	You can also assign messages to commits
	Messages are writing a caption for your snapshot


IN-DEPTH LOOK AT GIT/GITHUB
	FRAMEWORK
		my-app
			index.html
			style.css
			app.js
	WHAT THE COMMIT TIMELINE LOOKS LIKE
		First, Added files
		Second, Added markup (html)
		Third, Added CSS (color, theme, etc)
		Fourth, Added cast - JS Logic
			Send Entirety of FILES/FRAMEWORK to Cloud/Github THEN…
		Fifth, Add more JS
			Then send Entirety + Edited back up to Cloud/Github

WHAT’S GITHUB?
	A way to share code with others!
	An online place to store your code. (BACK UP IS GOOD!)
		BACK UP IS REALLY GOOD! (SO GOOD!)
			BACK UP IS CRUCIAL!
				YOU’RE BEING PAID A LOT OF MONEY!!!!
					BE SMART!
	It uses Git to help you manage your team’s work:
		Version tracking
		Reviewing changes
		Keep changes separate until you want to add them in
			Use the analogy of a engineering a physical object (hook blade)


GIT + GITHUB = AWESOME
	With Git (version control) and GitHub (online code storage), you can:



What’s A Repository?
	A repository is a collection of files that you’ve told Git to pay attention to
		Usually, one project = one repository
		Really large projects might have multiple repositories for different parts 		of their system (ie: front end vs back end)
		Repositories can live on GitHub and /or your computer


GITHUB is SOOO NICE ONCE YOU GET ACCLIMATED


TERMINAL COMMANDS
	git clone (url/directory here)
		pulls down a copy of the remote repository
					git clone (GitHub.com/user/repo-name.git)


TERMINAL COMMANDS 					(Identify colors “Red” and “Green”)
									RED = not added
									Green = added, ready for commit
	git status
		“Where am I? In the process of tracking things”
			Can use this after every command, to check if things are correct
	git add (file name)
		ACP - Add, Commit, Push
			stages a file for commit	
				DON’T FORGET THIS
	git add .
		stages all files (as opposed to one)

	git commit -m “added a sample text file”
		-m is a flag for a “message”
	
	git log
		shows all the commits (history of changes you’ve made)

	git push origin (origin means the original url) master
		upload changes onto github






AWS = (Amazon Web Services)
	Huge list of applications and services for developers
		Bean stalk (equivalent of GITHUB) is used by amazon








IN-DEPTH LOOK AT 
						HTML
						Hyper Text Markup Language




Everything created in HTML is a box 
		(as it shows up on the web browser)

Your understanding of HTML, needs to directly correspond to your layout physically on the browser

Building a “Wire Frame” at the beginning is a good idea.
	Just basically put your ideal website onto a paper through drawing
		Make one copy of what it looks like BEFORE CSS

Write ALL of your HTML before you even BEGIN to think about starting CSS
	
	Your boxes are going to align top to bottom first, but then inside each element, the next box goes laterally (left to right)

The higher your modern look of HTML will rank you higher in google.

BLOCK and INLINE  BLOCK:
	BLOCK stacks from top to bottom
	Block level elements take up the entire rest of the window

INLINE:
	INLINE stacks from left to right

PARENT/CHILD Hierarchy inside HTML utilizes INDENTATION
	<body> Parent, Grandparent, Great Grandparent to TAGS below
		<header>
			<h1>
			<nav>
				<ul> Parent to LI
					<li>
					<li>	child to UL, brother to LI




<div
		is an html 2, 3, and 4 component





<header
	<Div
		<Div
			<Div
					All these boxes go inside the header

CSS needs to account for all these extra boxes separately, so it looks more like this:

<header
	<nav
		<-1

DEFINITIONS


	Element:
		<p>hello world!</p>
			an element is comprised of an opening tag, closing tag, & content
	
	Attribute
		<a href=“google.com”>
			an attribute links to an outside source (link or file or image)

KEY VALUE PAIRS
	An attribute is a key/value pair
		IN CSS: background; color is a key/value pair
			It resides in all languages
	



















HTML COMMANDS
	<ul>
		unordered list
	<li>
		list item
	<a href=“google.com”>click me</a>
		Hyperlink reference
	<img src=“logo.png”>
		An image tag is a self closing tag
	<p id=“title”>cool</p>
		example of adding an ID to an element
	<!DOCTYPE html>
		ALWAYS the first tag in an html document
	<html>
		ALWAYS the second tag in an html document
	<head>
		Should always contain <title> (title shows up above address bar)
			“That holds meta information and dependencies for my html”
	<header>
		Different than <head> and goes inside <body>
	<title>
		displays title of page above
	<body>
		all of your content that displays, goes here…everything that displays
	<h1>
		big header
			Should only ever be one h1 on the page
	<h2>
		medium header, etc…
	<nav>
		navigations pane
			USE NAV for semantics and SEO (hiring) organization
	<main>
		Should contain ALL of the main content
	<img id=“logo” src=“http://placehold.it/200x100”>
		An ID is a unique identifier, you cannot use the same “logo” in any
		other ID’s
			Place Cage is a photo generator that places random photos in
	“http://placehold.it/200x100”
		Use this website to
	<section>
		better version of a <div>
	<div>
		box that should go into a <section>
	<ul id=“products”>
		<li><img src=“http://placehold.it/200x100”></li>
		<li><img src=“http://placehold.it/200x100”></li>
		<li><img src=“http://placehold.it/200x100”></li>
	</ul>




```


### These are notes for anybody to use.
